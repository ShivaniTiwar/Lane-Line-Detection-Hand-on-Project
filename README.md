# Lane-Line-Detection-Hand-on-Project
A lane detection project involves using computer vision techniques and algorithms to detect and track lane markings on the road in images or video streams. Lane detection is a fundamental component of many advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and self-driving car technologies. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to approach such a project:

1. Set Up Your Development Environment:

Choose a programming language and libraries for computer vision tasks. Python and OpenCV are popular choices.
Install the necessary packages and dependencies.
2. Collect Data:

Gather a dataset of images or video footage of roads with clearly marked lanes. You may use publicly available datasets or capture your own.
3. Preprocess the Data:

Read and load the image or video frames.
Apply any necessary preprocessing techniques like resizing, color adjustments, and noise reduction.
4. Edge Detection:

Use techniques like Canny edge detection to identify potential lane markings.
5. Region of Interest (ROI) Selection:

Define a region of interest to focus on the area where lanes are expected to appear. Exclude unnecessary areas like the sky or the car's hood.
6. Hough Transform:

Apply the Hough transform to convert edge points into lines. This can help you detect straight lines, which often represent lanes.
7. Line Detection and Filtering:

Filter the detected lines based on their slopes and positions to identify the left and right lane markings.
Calculate the slope and intercept of each line.
8. Lane Identification:

Group the lines into left and right lanes based on their slopes.
Average the slopes and intercepts of the detected lines to obtain a single line for each lane.
9. Drawing Lane Lines:

Overlay the detected lane lines on the original image or video frames.
10. Testing and Evaluation:

Evaluate your lane detection algorithm on various test cases and real-world scenarios.
Measure the accuracy, precision, and recall of your lane detection.
11. Fine-Tuning and Optimization:

Experiment with different parameters and algorithms to improve the accuracy and robustness of lane detection.
12. Real-time Processing:

If you are working with video, ensure your lane detection algorithm can process frames in real-time.
13. Additional Features (Optional):

Implement additional features like curve detection, lane change detection, or vehicle position relative to the lane.
14. Documentation and Reporting:

Document your project, including the algorithms used, dataset details, and results.
Create a user-friendly interface if needed.
15. Deployment:

If your lane detection system is intended for a specific application (e.g., in a self-driving car), integrate it into the larger system.
16. Testing on Real-world Scenarios:

Test your lane detection system in real-world driving conditions to ensure its reliability and safety.
17. Continuous Improvement:

Continue refining and improving your lane detection algorithm based on real-world feedback and new data.
Remember that lane detection is just one component of a broader autonomous driving system. Depending on your goals, you may need to integrate it with other components such as object detection, path planning, and control systems to build a complete self-driving car system.
